# GeoSylva — Dual Licensing

## This project is dual-licensed.

You may use GeoSylva under **one** of the following two licenses, at your choice:

---

## Option 1 — Open Source (AGPL-3.0)

GeoSylva is available under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)**.

Under this license, you are free to use, modify, and distribute the software,
including for commercial purposes, **provided you comply with all AGPL-3.0 obligations**:

- You must make the **complete corresponding source code** of your version available
  to all users who interact with the software, including over a network.
- Any modified version must also be licensed under AGPL-3.0.
- You must preserve copyright notices and license headers.

See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for the full AGPL-3.0 text.

This option is well suited for:
- Personal and educational use
- Open-source projects with AGPL-3.0-compatible licenses
- Any use where full source disclosure is acceptable

---

## Option 2 — Commercial License

If you wish to use GeoSylva **without complying with the AGPL-3.0 obligations**
(in particular, without disclosing your source code), you must obtain a
**separate commercial license** from the author.

A commercial license is typically needed when:

- **Proprietary integration**: incorporating GeoSylva into closed-source software.
- **SaaS / hosted services**: offering GeoSylva as part of a hosted platform
  without releasing the source code under AGPL-3.0.
- **Internal enterprise use**: deploying modified versions within an organization
  without publishing the source code.
- **Redistribution under different terms**: distributing GeoSylva or derivative
  works under a license other than AGPL-3.0.

### What the commercial license provides

- Permission to use GeoSylva without AGPL-3.0 source disclosure obligations.
- Freedom to integrate into proprietary and closed-source projects.
- Freedom to license derivative works under your own terms.
- Optional: priority support and consultation (depending on agreement).
